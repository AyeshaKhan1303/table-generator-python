# Table Generator (Python Project)

This is a beginner-friendly Python script that takes a number as input from the user and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

## Features:
- User input supported
- Clean and easy-to-understand logic
- Uses basic concepts like loops and multiplication

## Example Output:

Enter a number: 4  
4 x 1 = 4  
4 x 2 = 8  
...  
4 x 10 = 40

## Why I Built This:
To practice while loops and build confidence in taking input and showing meaningful output using Python.
